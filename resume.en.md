### SUMMARY ABOUT ME
I have 5 years of work experience.  For the first 3 years, I worked on the development of software platforms for large prestigious organizations such as national government offices, Japan Railway, and Banks employing waterfall and scrum development. For one year, I worked on various business process systems for local government offices. Since last year, I have been working on Mobile, Web, Big Data analysis for small systems employing scrum and [rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development).
On the side, I also worked on web development for my friend’s start up company for two years.
In addition, during university graduate work, I participated in [CERN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) in Switzerland and [Fermilab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermilab) in US as well as in Japan’s [KEK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KEK) for R&D activities of Elementary Particles Detector.
